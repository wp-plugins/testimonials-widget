Testimonials widget plugin allows you display testimonials in a widget on your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

Testimonial widget plugin allows you display testimonials in a widget on your WordPress blog. 

More than one widget can be displayed, each pulling from testimonial sets by using tags. Each displayed widget has its own identifier allowing for custom CSS styling.

You can make a simple client or portfolio rotator by using the testimonial field as the client or organization name, and the source field with the URL and tag as "portfolio". Then in the widget, show source and require tag "portfolio". 


**Features and notes**

* All testimonials (subject to filters) are in the html source so will be seen by google etc. 
* Testimony, author and source fields are clickable
* **Admin interface**: A nice admin interface to add, edit and manage testimonials. Details such as author and source of the quote, and attributes like tags and visibility, can be specified. The 'Testimonials' menu in the WP admin navigation leads to the admin interface.
* **Sidebar widget**: The Testimonials sidebar widget loads a testimonial then rotates through all available testimonials. Following is the list of options in the widget control panel:
	* Widget title
	* Option to show/hide author
	* Option to show/hide source
	* Choose refresh interval in seconds or set to 0 for static display
	* Choose random or sequential order for refresh
	* Show only quotes with certain tags
	* Show only quotes with all tags
	* Specify a character limit to filter out longer quotes
* Allows for multiple widgets. Useful for using tags to keep widgets separated.
* Compatible with WordPress 3.0 multi-site functionality.

1. Add and manage the quotes through the 'Testimonials' menu in the WordPress admin area

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do you include the actual testimonials for the widget? Where do I quote my customers? I mean, where do I enter the actual text? =

Checkout the first screenshot 1 at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/testimonials-widget/screenshots/ to see where to manage testimonials.

Basically, look down the left side of your WordPress admin area for the Testimonials sections. Click on that section link, then scroll down or click "Add new ttestimonial" to add quotes.

= What CSS applies to testimonials container? =

CSS class `testimonialswidget_testimonials` wraps all testimonials. Additionally, shortcode lists are wrapped by `testimonialswidget_testimonials testimonialswidget_testimonials_list`.

= What CSS applies to single testimonial container? =

CSS class `testimonialswidget_testimonial` wraps a single testimonial. Additionally, single shortcode list tems are wrapped by `testimonialswidget_testimonial testimonialswidget_testimonial_list`.

= How can I add the testimonials plugin to any where on the site? ie. somewhere other than the side bar like the contact page etc.? =

Use [testimonialswidget_list]. Usage examples are at the bottom of http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/testimonials-widget/.

Look for `[testimonialswidget_list]`.


= How do I hide the comma after the author? =

Use CSS.
`span.testimonialswidget_join {
	display: none;
}`

= Testimonials widget is not showing or rotating =

The usual problem is that jQuery is included twice. Once by WordPress and again by a theme. Remove the jQuery version included by your theme and you should be fine.

= I'm not seeing any testimonials but the title =

If you're not seeing any testimonials, even when not using tags filter, you might try increasing the Character limit or setting it to '0' or 'none' in the widget box.

= How do I apply custom CSS to a testimonial widget? =

The easiest thing is to check the source code of your page with the widget and look for the testimonial widgets div container id tag. It'll be something like `id="testimonials_widget-3"`.

= How to stop testimonial text/author/source being cut off? =

Specify a larger minimum height in the testimonials widget, see screenshot 2.

= How to get rid of the quotation marks that surround the random quote? =

Open the testimonials-widget.css file that comes along with the plugin, scroll down and look towards the bottom for the comment "Uncomment the block below if you want to get rid of the quotation marks before and after the quote".

= How to change the random quote text color? =

Styling such as text color, font size, background color, etc., of the random quote can be customized by editing the testimonials-widget.css file or applying CSS like the following.

`.testimonialswidget_testimonial q {
	color: blue;
}`

= How to change the admin access level setting for the quotes collection admin page? =

Change the value of the variable `$testimonialswidget_admin_userlevel` on line 33 of the testimonials-widget.php file. Refer [WordPress documentation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities) for more information about user roles and capabilities.
